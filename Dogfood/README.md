# Why?

Because. You build Dogfood and DLLs get clobbered. Maybe your DLLs were customized, and you wanted those versions. So you copy them from insite-commerce back into Dogfood. Again and again and again. With this script, you can set up the copying you need once and run it rapidly as many times as you need.
